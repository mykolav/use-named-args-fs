# Use named arguments for invocations of methods with multiple parameters of the same type.

## Motivation

Quoting from this [comment](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/issues/1216#issuecomment-304967649
) in a [new analyzer request](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/issues/1216#issuecomment-304967649).

> [...] analyzer here would enforce used of named arguments

> (or convertible to same type with implicit conversions).

## How does it work?

This analyzer looks at an invocation expression (e.g., a method call) and its arguments and suggests using named arguments according to the following rules:
- If a method or ctor has a number of parameters of the same type the invocation's corresponding arguments should be named.
- If named arguments are used for all but one parameter of the same type the analyzer doesn't emit a diagnostic. Two arguments of the same type cannot accidentally take each other's place in the described scenario. So the decision to have all the arguments named is a matter of code-style in this case and we leave it up to the developer.
- If the last parameter is `params`, the analyzer doesn't emit a diagnostic, as we cannot use named arguments in this case.
